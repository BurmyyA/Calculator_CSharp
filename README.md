# Calculator_CSharp

## What is it?
It is a calculator app. This app allows you to enter 2 numbers and choose if youd like to add, subtract, multiply or divide. Then it prints your answer to the list box at the bottom. 

## What did I learn?
Throughout this project I learned how similar some code is and that it can be repeated with slight changes.
Though throughout this unit as a whole I found that things such as constants are very useful and if not used can cause major issues or may even lead to incompletion in some programs.
